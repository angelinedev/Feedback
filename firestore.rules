/**
 * @fileOverview Firestore Security Rules for FeedLoop v2.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for student and faculty data,
 * while allowing authenticated users to read public data like questions and class mappings.
 * Feedback data is secured in a top-level collection and can only be created by the
 * student it belongs to, and read by relevant faculty and admins.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /students/{studentId}: Stores student profile data; accessible only by the student.
 * - /faculty/{facultyId}: Stores faculty profile data; accessible only by admins (for list) or the owner.
 * - /questions/{questionId}: Stores feedback questions; readable by any authenticated user.
 * - /classFacultyMapping/{mappingId}: Stores class-faculty-subject mappings; readable by any authenticated user.
 * - /feedback/{feedbackId}: Stores student feedback; write access for student, read access for faculty/admin.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Listing of student and faculty documents is restricted to admins to protect PII.
 * - Individual student/faculty can only read/write their own profile.
 * - Any authenticated user can read questions and mappings to populate forms.
 * - Students can only create feedback for themselves.
 * - Feedback is in a root collection to allow for easier querying by admins and faculty.
